Aspiration for Rebirth in Sukhāvatī
by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpe Nyima

chomdendé öpakmé la chaktsal lo
Homage to the bhagavan Amitābha!

yang yang dren no shyingkham dewachen
Again and again I reflect on the Sukhāvatī realm.
nying né dren no drenpa öpakmé
With all my heart I recollect the guide Amitābha.
tsechik dren no gyalsé gyatsö khor
Single-pointedly I recall the oceanic retinue of bodhisattvas.
jingyi lob shik kyabmé kyobpé tsok
Grant your blessings, assembled guardians of the refugeless,
tukjé daknyi gönpo khyé nam la
Before you all, protectors and embodiments of compassion,
güpé chaktsal chötrin gyatsö chö
I prostrate in devotion and present oceans of offering-clouds;
diktung kün shak gé la jé yi rang
I confess all my misdeeds and downfalls and rejoice in virtue;
chökhor kor shyin nya ngen mi da sol
And I implore you to turn the Dharma Wheel, not pass into nirvāṇa.

dak gi khanyam drowé dön ledu
So that I might accomplish complete and perfect awakening,
yangdak dzokpé changchub drubjé chir
For the sake of beings as infinite in number as space is vast,
sangye shyingkham yongsu jongwa yi
May I fulfil an ocean of aspirations towards liberation
namtar mönlam gyatso dzok gyur chik
With my perfected training in cultivating pure realms.

di tsön gewé dak sok yichen kün
Through the virtue represented here, may I and all who possess a mind
chima dakpé shyingkham dewachen
Take birth in our next lives in that pure realm of Sukhāvatī,
mejung ngotsar köpé rab dzepar
Which is so sublime and wondrous in its features and design,
kyé né tek chok gatön nyongwar shok
And there may we feast upon the teachings of the supreme vehicle.

Jigme wrote this for a spiritual friend named Oḍḍiyāna.
